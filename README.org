~multilign.el~ is a tiny minor mode for displaying multiline string literals with padded indents,
correctly aligning continuation lines to the first line of text (per the string's output).

It is entirely a display property, using font-lock-mode to apply and update visible portions of the buffer, and does *not* make any modifications to the underlying text.


Configuration:

Clone this repo with Elpaca / straight.el, or just copy the 100 or so lines of code to your config file.

Add to any major-mode hook
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'multilign-mode) ;; recommended
#+end_src

Disclaimer:

This is a fairly new package, mainly tested so far on lisp-y modes and on Emacs 29.1 where it caused a number of crashes during development due to jit-lock freezing up the UI in a loop. I've added some guards against this happening but bug reports are welcome üêõ
